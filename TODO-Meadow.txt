creature todo
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
		eventually :tm:
	climb-only critters have a rough time without wall-jumps hmm
	will add universal pole-tip jump
- show creature pipes
	some rooms are only solvable with them, they aren't well known
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight
- need to sample color of creature and have it in skindata
	- requires final-ish seeds

player grabbing cicada = laggy physics
	some mechanism for lending/borrowing control over an entity
	main entity would sim both,
		side who leased would still sim self attached to main
	grabbing disabled for now

lizard todo
- charge
- fall + diagdown = slide
- sometimes fails to grab poles when holding up
- find a good seed for our buddies

scav todo
- jump from tip of pole / done
- won't jump on slopes / check again
- hands look silly when walking on falsefloor
- jumping off ledge wack because regains footing too quick?
	
slugcat in meadow mode
- point things

squidcicada todo
button for spin/dance

eggbug
	update art / done
	pick seeds and names
	jump impl
		missing let go of ground

noot
	make art
	pick seeds and names
	movement feels a tad boring
		make tail float around more?

	scream

lantermouse
	move n jump

water controls for lizard and scav etc
	needs to be there, crossing DS etc
	SU_A12
	I think the pathing logic breaks, water "isn't accessible" but it is. Istileaccessibletocreature accounts for it, some of my logic might not


feedback
cheat button freezes / done
lizard can get stuck on poletip unable to jump / done?
lizard entering pipe jitters in place (outside of pipe) / done, issue was RPCs
lizard often misses grabbing pole on jump
creature pipe indicators would be really helpful /done

scav movement overshoots

controller-disconnedted popup might be inconsistent

visualize selected skin
	will get color previews
	but could have tiny screenshots

rat can't beat 3-tiles-tall jump
	maybe vertfact/horizfact to help

tint implementation missing in most creatures
eggbug collapses on room transition (wolfy dms has logs)

eggbug feels slow
eggbug should have super jump at all times not just pounce, match how jumpy they are in game

noodle has hard time going into pipes
noodle could have a "grounded" state like cada

"creature emotions" need addressing
lizards shouldn't open mouth to bite
rats shouldn't panic

creature select can be inconsistent at times: I have big noodlefly selected, i enter the game, i'm small, i log off and click big again, now i'm big

emote preview background color is really bad right now

your avatar is marked as non-transferable, but on a gate it's re-registered in the new region and that flag is missing / no longer re-registered, should be ok

sandbox unlock items still present in meadow lmao
