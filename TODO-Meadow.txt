what are the player-player interactions?
- spot eachother
- greet eachother
- greet others
- decide on what to do
	- likely want to go somewhere, what other options
	- echo-hunting
	- go to one of the extremes of the map
		- pebbles, moon, SI or Depths
	- games
		- hide and seek
- decide on where to go
	- a direction, a landmark, something unambiguous
	- anywhere
	- follow me, follow the leader

- move together
- spot things, comment on things
- tell others to come over here
- tell others to go back, not come

handholding
	would be so nice to grab cicada be carried by liz etc etc
	"it's of uttermost importance to me that one cannot troll others with this"
	either:
		- invite and accept-to-be-held; or
		- be grabbed by, with no consequences
			you are not heavier nor locked out of anything, no downsides
			Sky has both, with the invite system, but also the "follow"->"hold hand"

creature todo
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
		eventually :tm:
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight (very low prio)
- need to sample color of creature and have it in skindata
	- requires final-ish seeds

lizard todo
- sometimes fails to grab poles when holding up
- cyan-jump from any state
- find a good seed for our buddies

scav todo
- movement tends to overshoot
- leap sometimes goes up/back
- hands look silly when walking on falsefloor
- jumping off ledge wack because regains footing too quick?

slugcat in meadow mode
- point things

squidcicada todo
button for spin/dance ?
remove charge ?

eggbug
	pick seeds and names

noot
	pick seeds and names

lantermouse
	jump too small
	seeds and names
	add emotes


controller-disconnedted popup might be inconsistent

visualize selected skin
	will get color previews
	but could have tiny screenshots

tint implementation missing in most creatures
eggbug collapses on room transition (wolfy dms has logs)

eggbug feels slow
eggbug should have super jump at all times not just pounce, match how jumpy they are in game

noodle has hard time going into pipes
noodle could have a "grounded" state like cada

"creature emotions" need addressing
lizards shouldn't open mouth to bite
rats shouldn't panic

creature select can be inconsistent at times: I have big noodlefly selected, i enter the game, i'm small, i log off and click big again, now i'm big

emote preview background color is really bad right now

emote keybind not rebindable

emote mapping on keyboard 1 throug 8 missing

sandbox unlock items still present in meadow lmao

passage but the map isn't saving

following others around is hard
	need map implemented
	could use pipes flashing colors if room inhabited
	player list on passage screen

wormgrass can still eat you (big patches in FA)

rat can spawn with tail attached

sometimes one loads in the wrong region? might have to do with enabling mods shifting region indexes

echo sky animation is too slow needs to converge

echo reward anim is bad, fade to white is bad, no confetti??

cursor disappears on fullscreen nondevtools etc

wish there was a symbol for outskirts

rat can't go through floors on the floor??

scavenger gets stuck climbing close to top, won't go out of swingmode

double jumps out of the water, way too much speed

liz side of pole jump weak

liz holding down didn't go down floor

ds a09, the crawlspace on left, creatures don't snap to crawling in it

ds c03 exist is at water height wont path

creatures not cleared on enter creature pipe

echo tentacle bounces bet screens in long rooms

scav climbpos doesn't sync

liz pounce problem! pre-moon room, can't clear pounce jump

liz overall air after jump is bad, too much friction, where is it coming from??
