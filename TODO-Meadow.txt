creature todo
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
		eventually :tm:
	climb-only critters have a rough time without wall-jumps hmm
	will add universal pole-tip jump
- show creature pipes
	some rooms are only solvable with them, they aren't well known
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight
- on gate transition, pathing visualizer bugs out
- need to sample color of creature and have it in skindata
	- requires final-ish seeds

player grabbing cicada = laggy physics
	some mechanism for lending/borrowing control over an entity
	main entity would sim both,
		side who leased would still sim self attached to main
	grabbing disabled for now

lizard todo
- charge
- fall + diagdown = slide
- sometimes fails to grab poles when holding up
- find a good seed for our buddies

scav todo
- jump from tip of pole / done
- won't jump on slopes / check again
- hands look silly when walking on falsefloor
- jumping off ledge wack because regains footing too quick?
	
slugcat in meadow mode
- point things

squidcicada todo
button for spin/dance

eggbug
	update art / done
	pick seeds and names
	jump impl
		missing let go of ground

noot
	make art
	pick seeds and names
	movement feels a tad boring
		make tail float around more?

	scream

lantermouse
	move n jump

water controls for lizard and scav etc
	needs to be there, crossing DS etc
	SU_A12
	I think the pathing logic breaks, water "isn't accessible" but it is. Istileaccessibletocreature accounts for it, some of my logic might not
