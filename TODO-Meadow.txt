plants todo
- mechanism for respawning items
- respawn item on item gone
- revisit spawn conditions
- make sure tospawn etc are being synched properly

progression todo
	could have first few creature unlocks be easier the rest harder
	reorder liz squid

Save system
	save color/tint of characters
	
Menu todo
	hide tint on locked character
	use saved colors

emotes todo
"wish I could "stop" an emote block and start a new one, instead of having to wait out the fade"
	maybe pressing backspace? should it clear or not clear the current group? /ok
	what about controller?
mapping going to 0 - = is a bit weird
	- = don't work on most euro layouts /can'tfix
		an alternative would be to skip unity and go straight to user32 key events that are virtualkey based
		here's hoping that the next update has better unity version or even usephisicalkeys who knows
		try getting presses through rewired-keyboard? maybe it's good there?
	but but but 12 emotes...
	rethink the whole thing damn it
radial menu
	/ should be working on xbox
	todo sort out mappings for dualshock (ps 3 4 5) and switchpro
	need to swap between the two inputs as needed not have the two / done
	maybe more than 8 per page? this thing has a lot of pages...
		12 per page would be interesting/ideal, but no keyboard support...
rethink kb input
	one configurable hotbar with 10 the rest on mouse?
	really really wish I could support "fully keyboard input"
		maybe the radial?
	study Meadow update, they've cooked it enough

creature todo
- shelter activation? does nothing atm anyways
- other story-mode things?
- any ways to die left?
	player (slugcat) can drown
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed

player grabbing cicada = laggy physics

really hard to enter pipe sometimes
	still the case, needs body shrinkage?

lizard todo
- charge
- find a good seed for our buddies

lizard still bites cicada
	// how?
lizard on first load doesn't get colors assigned ?? firstload in realize room vs load far and walk in?
	
slugcat in meadow mode
- lookdir input like the others
- point things
- go through creature pipes
	since no spears around

eggbug
	update art
	pick seeds

noot
	make art
	pick seeds

water controls for lizard and scav etc
	needs to be there, crossing DS etc
	SU_A12
	I think the pathing logic breaks, water "isn't accessible" but it is. Istileaccessibletocreature accounts for it, some of my logic might not
