items todo
	items could be a little higher from the ground
		too high up becomes a problem for liz though?
			could be property of avatar, how high off the ground it hovers
		/done-ish
	slugcar collision could be better, lower body doesnt hit
		/done

progression todo
	could have first few creature unlocks be easier the rest harder
		nahhh

Save system
	save selected skin of character / done
	save color/tint of characters / done
	
Menu todo
	hide tint on locked character / done
	use saved colors / done

	tint resulting color preview

emotes todo
"wish I could "stop" an emote block and start a new one, instead of having to wait out the fade"
	maybe pressing backspace? should it clear or not clear the current group? /ok
	what about controller?
mapping going to 0 - = is a bit weird
	- = don't work on most euro layouts /can'tfix
		an alternative would be to skip unity and go straight to user32 key events that are virtualkey based
		here's hoping that the next update has better unity version or even usephisicalkeys who knows
		try getting presses through rewired-keyboard? maybe it's good there?
	but but but 12 emotes...
	rethink the whole thing damn it
radial menu
	/ should be working on xbox
	todo sort out mappings for dualshock (ps 3 4 5) and switchpro
	need to swap between the two inputs as needed not have the two / done
	maybe more than 8 per page? this thing has a lot of pages...
		12 per page would be interesting/ideal, but no keyboard support...
rethink kb input
	one configurable hotbar with 10 the rest on mouse?
	really really wish I could support "fully keyboard input"
		maybe the radial?
	study Meadow update, they've cooked it enough

teleporting
	to outskirts
	to hub of [current region]
	to home
		home is initially set to thematic region
		creatures otherwise spawn in outskirts


creature todo
- shelter activation? does nothing atm anyways
- other story-mode things?
- any ways to die left?
	player (slugcat) can drown /done
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
- show creature pipes
	some rooms are only solvable with them, they aren't well known
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to

walking down falsefloor
	groundctrl might need to check for y<0 && tile.isfloor

player grabbing cicada = laggy physics

really hard to enter pipe sometimes
	still the case, needs body shrinkage?

lizard todo
- charge
- find a good seed for our buddies
- fall + diagdown = slide

lizard on first load doesn't get colors assigned ?? firstload in realize room vs load far and walk in?
	
slugcat in meadow mode
- lookdir input like the others / done
- point things
- go through creature pipes / done

eggbug
	update art
	pick seeds and names

noot
	make art
	pick seeds and names

water controls for lizard and scav etc
	needs to be there, crossing DS etc
	SU_A12
	I think the pathing logic breaks, water "isn't accessible" but it is. Istileaccessibletocreature accounts for it, some of my logic might not
