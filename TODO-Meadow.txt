progression todo
	implement emote progression

Save system
	emote hotbar config
	
Menu todo
	tint resulting color preview
	back out to lobby when quit from game

emotes todo
"wish I could "stop" an emote block and start a new one, instead of having to wait out the fade"
	maybe pressing backspace? should it clear or not clear the current group? /ok
	what about controller?
mapping going to 0 - = is a bit weird
	- = don't work on most euro layouts /can'tfix
		an alternative would be to skip unity and go straight to user32 key events that are virtualkey based
		here's hoping that the next update has better unity version or even usephisicalkeys who knows
		try getting presses through rewired-keyboard? maybe it's good there?
	but but but 12 emotes...
	rethink the whole thing damn it
radial menu
	/ should be working on xbox
	todo sort out mappings for dualshock (ps 3 4 5) and switchpro
	need to swap between the two inputs as needed not have the two / done
	maybe more than 8 per page? this thing has a lot of pages...
		12 per page would be interesting/ideal, but no keyboard support...
rethink kb input
	one configurable hotbar with 10 the rest on mouse?
	really really wish I could support "fully keyboard input"
		maybe the radial?
	study Meadow update, they've cooked it enough

So the plan is
	there's a list of emotes with all available ones as a grid, clickable
	the list can be shown/hidden with a shortcut or a button on screen

	there's a hotbar that is customizable, comes pre-filled with default things
		default is your 3 initial emotions, plus important/generic symbols
		customize the hotbar by hovering an emote and pressing the new keybind
		or by click-and-drag?
	the hotbar can be shown/hidden with a shortcut or a button on screen
	keys 1~0 bound to the hotbar (1~8?) (1~12?)
	the toggle hide shortcut respects whether you wanted only hotbar or only emotes

	there's a radial menu, bound to a new keybind
		on keyboard that's C
		on controller that's left-shoulder
	this radial menu has 8 (12?) sides
	holding the keybind brings the menu up, releasing it confirms your selection
		holding a direction for an option, neutral to cancel
		since it's using the same input as "point", lock character from pointing until direction released
	the radial menu's main page reflects the hotbar
	2 new keybinds swap pages back and forth
		on keyboard that's mouse left/right click or scrollwheel (for mouse people), OR right-shift/right-ctrl (for arrow people)
			what about touch-based? steamdeck etc, left/right click collides with click-and-drag for selection
				future me problem I guess
		on controller that's triggers

	12 vs 8 slots on hotbar/pages
	8 is very kb-friendly but a lot of pages, and page boundaries don't line up with categories? kb-frend for directional input
	12 is less pages, lines up with categories, but binding -= doesn't work out-of-the-box on several layouts, and diagonals on kb become complex (needs to remember last non-diag, harder to flicker on controller)

	

teleporting
	to outskirts
	to hub of [current region]
	to home
		home is initially set to thematic region
		creatures otherwise spawn in outskirts

creature todo
- shelter activation? does nothing atm anyways
	in meadow could save your "home"
	could allow passage to known shelters
- other story-mode things?
- any ways to die left?
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
		eventually :tm:
	climb-only critters have a rough time without wall-jumps hmm
- show creature pipes
	some rooms are only solvable with them, they aren't well known
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight
- on gate transition, pathing visualizer bugs out

player grabbing cicada = laggy physics
	some mechanism for lending/borrowing control over an entity
	main entity would sim both,
		side who leased would still sim self attached to main

lizard todo
- charge
- fall + diagdown = slide
- find a good seed for our buddies

scav todo
- jump from tip of pole
- won't jump on slopes
- hands look silly when walking on falsefloor
- jumping off ledge wack because regains footing too quick?
	
slugcat in meadow mode
- point things

squidcicada todo
button for spin/dance

eggbug
	update art
	pick seeds and names

noot
	make art
	pick seeds and names
	movement feels a tad boring
		make tail float around more?

	scream

water controls for lizard and scav etc
	needs to be there, crossing DS etc
	SU_A12
	I think the pathing logic breaks, water "isn't accessible" but it is. Istileaccessibletocreature accounts for it, some of my logic might not
