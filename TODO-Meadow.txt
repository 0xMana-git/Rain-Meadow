plants todo
- sync timer and collected (so can be transfered)
- respawn a plant on plant expired

- more items
	copy the arena unlocks


emotes todo
on emote already expiring shouldn't be able to emote more /ok
 + or instead should replace the old emotes, start new group /ok
"wish I could "stop" an emote block and start a new one, instead of having to wait out the fade"
	maybe pressing backspace? should it clear or not clear the current group? /ok
mapping going to 0 - = is a bit weird
	- = don't work on most euro layouts /can'tfix
		an alternative would be to skip unity and go straight to user32 key events that are virtualkey based
		here's hoping that the next update has better unity version or even usephisicalkeys who knows
	but but but 12 emotes...
instinct was to click the emotes /ok
not seeing all emotes at once is a bit of a hinger /ok
	takes time to find them switching pages
	time means you lose the combo
"sometimes can't use emotes" - SleepyCup
	either bug or unintuitive timer lock /ok
radial menu
	shoulders to swap pages seems like what most games do
	some games have the "button to bring up + release to commit", some have you press a confirm/select


creature todo
- shelter activation
- gate activation / done
- other story-mode things?
- can still drown/die in several ways
coming out of pipe + lag = stuck "pipe entering"
come out of shortcut = bugged af doesn't clear shortcut pointer
player grabbing cicada = laggy physics
on wackamole pipe, game picks randomly I think, maybe should be player-chosen / done, cycles

tint color doesnt work on controller
lis from pole jump too weak
checking "any y" controller picks pole when it shouldn't
really hard to enter pipe sometimes

lizard todo
- walking off ledge /done
- go through floors
- charge
- pounce / done
- head rotation should really prefer unrotated
- head blinking seems a bit much, how control?
- find a good seed for our buddies

lizard still bites cicada
lizard on first load doesn't get colors assigned
	
clear animation on jump / done

test blue lizard jump
