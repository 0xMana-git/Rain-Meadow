plants todo
- sync timer
- respawn

emotes todo
on emote already expiring shouldn't be able to emote more
 + or instead should replace the old emotes, start new group
"wish I could "stop" an emote block and start a new one, instead of having to wait out the fade"
	maybe pressing backspace? should it clear or not clear the current group?
mapping going to 0 - = is a bit weird
	- = don't work on most euro layouts
instinct was to click the emotes
not seeing all emotes at once is a bit of a hinger
	takes time to find them switching pages
	time means you lose the combo
"sometimes can't use emotes" - SleepyCup
	either bug or unintuitive timer lock


creature todo
- shelter activation
- gate activation
- other story-mode things?
- can still drown/die in several ways
coming out of pipe + lag = stuck "pipe entering"
come out of shortcut = bugged af doesn't clear shortcut pointer
karma in gates
player grabbing cicada = laggy physics
on wackamole pipe, game picks randomly I think, maybe should be player-chosen

lizard todo
- walking off ledge /done
- charge
- pounce / done
- head rotation should really prefer unrotated
- head blinking seems a bit much, how control?
- find a good seed for our buddies
- maybe seed could be a setting for the most special skin? any skin?
lizard still bites cicada
lizard on first load doesn't get colors assigned
creature pipes behavior undefined
	picks closest? random?
	in room to drainage impossible to get up?
	
clear animation on jump / done
standing jump / done
jump from pole / done

test blue lizard jump
	shouldn't re-grip unless input up? / done
	

blue lizard make it prefer ground

playable scav
