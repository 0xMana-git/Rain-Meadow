plants todo
- sync timer and collected (so can be transfered)
- respawn a plant on plant expired

- more items
	copy the arena unlocks
		a collectoken is a UAD, but my objects so far (MeadowCollectible) were POs
		inheriting CT means I need to implement UAD sync ("shouldn't be too complicated") besides getting it to work
		ineriting MeadowCollectible means I need to copypaste a ton of code to make it work like a token
		maybe an empty-ish PO that spawns a token for visuals/collision?
		it reeeeally wants placeobjdata and "is blue" vs "is gold", is it worth the trouble?

	
emotes todo
"wish I could "stop" an emote block and start a new one, instead of having to wait out the fade"
	maybe pressing backspace? should it clear or not clear the current group? /ok
	what about controller?
mapping going to 0 - = is a bit weird
	- = don't work on most euro layouts /can'tfix
		an alternative would be to skip unity and go straight to user32 key events that are virtualkey based
		here's hoping that the next update has better unity version or even usephisicalkeys who knows
	but but but 12 emotes...
	rethink the whole thing damn it
radial menu
	/ should be working on xbox
	todo sort out mappings for dualshock (ps 3 4 5) and switchpro
	need to swap between the two inputs as needed not have the two / done
	maybe more than 8 per page? this thing has a lot of pages...
		12 per page would be interesting/ideal, but no keyboard support...
rethink kb input
	one configurable hotbar with 10 the rest on mouse?
	really really wish I could support "fully keyboard input"
		maybe the radial?
add backdrop to previews / done

creature todo
- shelter activation? does nothing atm anyways
- gate activation / done
- other story-mode things?
- any ways to die left?
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
	but maybe an unstuck button is in order? / done

player grabbing cicada = laggy physics

tint color slider/picker doesnt work on controller / done

really hard to enter pipe sometimes
	still the case, needs body shrinkage?

lizard todo
- charge
- head rotation should really prefer unrotated
- head blinking seems a bit much, how control?
- find a good seed for our buddies

lizard still bites cicada
	// how?
lizard on first load doesn't get colors assigned ?? firstload in realize room vs load far and walk in?
	
blue lizard make it prefer ground
	work as non-climber unless UP
	/ reworked so will preferr "keepig same acessibility as current path"

playable scav
- up a pole sucks // done
- go through floors // done?

slugcat in meadow mode
- lookdir input like the others
- point things

Toss in eggbug and noodlefly
- make flying controller template?
- do "wall-crawlers" deserve their own template or just better handling of climb/noclimb modes?

water controls for lizard and scav etc
	needs to be there, crossing DS etc
	SU_A12
	I think the pathing logic breaks, water "isn't accessible" but it is. Istileaccessibletocreature accounts for it, some of my logic might not
