"wish I could "stop" an emote block and start a new one, instead of having to wait out the fade"
	maybe pressing backspace? should it clear or not clear the current group? /ok
	what about controller?
mapping going to 0 - = is a bit weird
	- = don't work on most euro layouts /can'tfix

	rethink the whole thing damn it
