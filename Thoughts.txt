	Players will always be testing boundaries
		I'm new to this, what can I do, what feedback can I get
		what happens if I just fuck around
		what happens if I fire this gun at this other player

		guns will fire, trolls will troll

	When you're online and in near-anonimity, you have very little to lose
		The most you can lose is your own in-game investments

		This can be applied to more vulnerable mechanisms, so that players use them consciously
			interactions can be locked behind time investment, or resource investment
