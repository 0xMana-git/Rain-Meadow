Rain Meadow

on join, takes a while to get lobby data, grey out button

Manage missing regions:
	right now nullrefs because missing referenced resource
	only joinable on same world-checksum? world-list? world-index-checksum?

need new hookpoint for objects being moved between worlds, so they're added to the new world 
	but maybe just the removal-addal works?

world registers entities
entities need to be transferable
on leave, transfer leftovers, remove untransferables

thinking more and more they'll work like resources
on leaving an entity behind, transfer it to someone else who has the room active, or return to super (world)


try enabling creature spawns
	spanws on if world owner
	needs resource available earlier in the load process so this can be turned on/off accordingly


handle disconnects
