Rain Meadow

Multiplayer menu
	have a look at new mixed-mode so can use scrollbox for lobbies?

Lobby join
	done

New game session type
	created
	control spawning of things depending on whether you're the host or not
		creatures done
		todo items
		todo room objects
			what objects do we let spawn?
		remove quantified creatures

basic netcode
	on load resource, request resource
		wont this hiccup every time?
		should it store a list of owners, or query super-owner every time?
	request ownership vs subscribe


if lobby owner
	every X ticks update other players on world-owners

if world owner
	every x ticks update other players on room-owners
	every x ticks update other players on abstract-states

if room owner
	every x ticks update other players on item-owners
	every x ticks update other players on room state
else
	every x ticks update room owner on owned items state


	feed on region cross crashed because resource gone
	entity leaving room that was deactivated = bad
	on join, takes a while to get lobby data, grey out button



Mod auto installing / auto disabling



Manage missing regions:
	right now nullrefs because missing referenced resource

World loader takes longer than lease to load, tries to initiate worldsession on not-yet-ready world
	maybe actual resource calls activate/deactivate, lease-independent? will it always be in a consistent state?
