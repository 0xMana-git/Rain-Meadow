Entities entities entities
	
	handle entities entering dens
		could also be event-based
		would maybe also have to handle the whole switchcase at "the end of the shortcut" when the creature then either enters a den or leaves the room or whatever
	
	handle grasps
		grasps need to be sent around in a similar way entities are
		the biggest problem is: can only send grasps once we've identified all entities involved
		on entity-join, if all connected entities already join, then send grasps?
		how do we handle entity leave from the non-owner side? because an entity that has grasps will try and move many things with it
			how do we even detect that?
		
		if it's things that are moving together maybe the events should be just one event
		"move with grabbed"
		or maybe this should be the default, since ent.move DOES move things together??
		how do I detect things that are being moved together?
			.move is recursive isn't it
			does the absgrasp know of the realgrasp?
	
	just disable grasps for now and crack on with persona-only stuff??
		"I have failed and I'll move on with simpler things"


Mod auto installing / auto disabling
	biggest issue: different region list
		scenario: host that has ABC, guests have AB, BC and CA, host leaves nobody can take over hosting
	enforced mod-sync on join lobby
		anything that changes world folders
		plus weird world-state changing chings like expedition/remix?
	could use a whitelist maybe
	could automate it some:
		apply automatically, re-launch and re-join the lobby in question
		disable all other mods temporarily, store old enabledlist, relaunch with right mods


Imediate todo:

on sleep
	should wait release before enabling the start button
