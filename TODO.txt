Rain Meadow

Multiplayer menu
	done-ish
	will need more func

Lobby join
	done

Trigger start from host start

Go in game with right join type


New game session type
	created
	control spawning of things depending on whether you're the host or not


WorldLoader.GeneratePopulation fucks up
	needs SaveState for lineages or at least it thinks it does.
