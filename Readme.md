# Rain Meadow
## This is a work in progress 

## What is this

An online multiplayer experience build on top of Rain World.

Do you know Meadow from Might&Delight, the Shelter series guys? If you don't, maybe you should! This is a reinterpretation of that multiplayer experience, but in the Rain World universe.

## Why not fix Monkland

I'm not experienced enough to fully understand and fix someone else's mod, by making my own I'll learn all I need to learn along the way. Also there was a massive update to the game, and they've update the Steamworks library that is used, it's the perfect time to start over.

## Do you have any prior experiences with multiplayer?

I'm an Automation engineer with experience in devices communicating with industrial protocols over lossy, laggy networks, as well as server API design. While I haven't properly done game netcode before, I can design protocols and write serialization with some confidence.
