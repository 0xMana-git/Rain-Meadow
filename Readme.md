# Rain Meadow
## This is a work in progress

![title banner](/Docs/banner.png)

## What is this

An online multiplayer experience built on top of Rain World. It's currently scoped to support Arena, Story, and a custom game-mode called Meadow.

Do you know [Meadow from Might&Delight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/486310/Meadow/), the Shelter series guys? If you don't, maybe you should! This custom game-mode is a reinterpretation of that multiplayer experience, but in the Rain World universe.

## How will it work

Rain Meadow is a mod that can be loaded as just any mod. Each player launches their game and joins a lobby. Lobbies can be created with different game-modes selected, and the lobby owner can tweak settings for a lobby. Hot-join is supported and configurable.

## What is the current state of this project

We're currently still refining the engine. It's a totally custom engine, since RW doesn't use Unity stuff much. We've started fronts on customizations for each game-mode as well.

## Can I play it / Where can I find more

You can find playtesting builds and the full devlog over at [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ze3qaYq49j).

## How can we support this project?

Fuss about it, spread the word. You can also donate to the devs over at [my ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/henpemaz). If you're an experienced c# dev or you make rainworld mods, you can join the team to try and help with development!

## Why not fix Monkland

When I started this project, my initial thought was that I'm not experienced enough to fully understand and fix someone else's mod, by making my own I'll learn all I need to learn along the way. Also there was a massive update to the game, and they've update the Steamworks library that is used, it's the perfect time to start over.

This seems to be true since now I can fully understand the code for Monkland and all of its limitations.

## Do you have any prior experiences with multiplayer?

I'm an Automation engineer with experience in devices communicating with industrial protocols over lossy, laggy networks, as well as server API design. While I haven't properly done game netcode before, I can design protocols and write serialization with some confidence.
